# Files
In this experiment, we followed the design and updated the codes from https://github.com/MarioniLab/oor_design_reproducibility. To get the embeddings from different design (CR, ACR and scMulan), please run the **submit_oor_design_v2.sh** with different settings.

 **COVID_design.ipynb** contains the downstream analysis with Milo and comparison between the designs.

# Requirement
The additional environment requirement is the same as https://github.com/MarioniLab/oor_benchmark.
